The project involved building a well-functioning cascading select feature for one of the projects at your company.
The key challenge you overcame was handling the complex scenario of supporting multiple choices.
The form can be accessed at the URL: https://ee.s2bi.africa/x/egx2KAHc.
The aim of the project was to design a cascading select with the following parameters:
Semaine (Week)
Superviseur (Supervisor)
Enquêteur (Enumerator)
Type de foyer (Household type)
Nom du ménage (Household name)
Only Semaine and Nom du ménage had unique choices.
The remaining three parameters (Superviseur, Enquêteur, Type de foyer) had the possibility of appearing in multiple weeks (Semaine).
